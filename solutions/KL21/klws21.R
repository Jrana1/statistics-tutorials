# Task 2
#2. In a computer science course the projects P1, P2, P3, P4 are offered.
#   Each of the 60 students must sign up for one of the projects offered.
#   All projects are equally popular among the students. Determine the
#   probability that
#   (a) exactly 15 students register for every of the four projects
#   (b) more than 15 students sign up for project P1.
#   Assume that the number of places in the projects is unlimited:

# year, an introductory computer course is held at the beginning
#of the winter semester. From many years of experience, we know that
#about 11% of the registered course participants do not show up for
#the course. Since each participant needs his own computer during the
#course, no more participants can take part in the course than there are
#free computers. In total, there are ten rooms with 22 seats each and a
#total of 240 first-year students. Using an approximation by the central
#limit theorem, calculate

#(a) the probability that all students who are present for the course
#will find a seat if all first-year students have registered for the
#course.
